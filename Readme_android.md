# Ffilesystem for Android

Using CMake and the Android [Native Development Kit (NDK)](https://github.com/android/ndk), Ffilesystem can be built for Android from the command line.
Android NDK supports multiple operating systems and is
[installed via Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk#default-version)
or Homebrew:
