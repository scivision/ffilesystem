Platform independent (Linux, macOS, Windows, Cygwin, WSL, ...), object-oriented Fortran filesystem path manipulation library.
The library also provides header
[filesystem.h](./include/filesystem.h)
that can be used from C and C++ project code--see
[example](./example).
This Fortran library uses
[C++ stdlib filesystem](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem)
internally.
Also inspired by
[Python pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).

Fortran "filesystem" module contains Fortran type "path_t" that contains properties and methods.
The "path_t" type uses getter and setter procedure to access the path as a string `character(:), allocatable`.

```fortran
use filesystem, only : path_t

type(path_t) :: p

p = path_t("my/path")  !< setter

print *, "path: ", p%path() !< getter
```

Due to compiler limitations, currently Fortran-filesystem only officially supports ASCII characters.

## Compiler support

Full C++ filesystem support and hence full Fortran-filesystem features are available with any of these compilers:

* GCC &ge; 8 (g++, gfortran)
* LLVM Clang &ge; 7 (clang++, flang or gfortran)
* Intel oneAPI (icx, ifx, icpc, ifort, icl)
* Flang
* NVidia HPC SDK (nvc++, nvfortran)
* AOCC AMD Optimizing Compilers (clang++, flang)
* Visual Studio (C++) + oneAPI (Fortran)
* Cray: C++ filesystem: using GCC or Intel backend with cray.cmake toolchain
* Cray: non-C++ fallback functions: using Cray compilers alone (cc, ftn)

Expected to work with other
[C++17 compilers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support)
and Fortran 2008 compilers yet to be tested.
E.g. IBM XL, NAG, et al.
In particular, the compiler and the libstdc++ must both support filesystem as well as Fortran 2008.

For compilers without functioning C++ filesystem, we provide a fallback set of filesystem features using the C runtime library and our own Fortran routines.
This fallback is enabled automatically when C++ filesystem is not available when CMake option `-Dfallback_auto=yes` is specified.
The installed CMake package provides BOOL CMake variable `ffilesystem_fallback` that can be used to check if the fallback routines are enabled.
To force enable the fallback routines, for example for testing:

```sh
cmake -B build -Dfallback=on
```

Note: to avoid end users missing features inadvertently, by default the fallback is disabled unless requested or enabled.
To allow automatic fallback, set:

```sh
cmake -B build -Dfallback_auto=on
```

### libstdc++

Some systems have broken, obsolete, or incompatible libstdc++.

**Intel**: If Intel compiler linker errors use GCC >= 9.1.
This can be done by setting environment variable CXXFLAGS to the top level GCC >= 9.1 directory.
Set environment variable CXXFLAGS for
[Intel GCC toolchain](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-dpcpp-cpp-compiler-dev-guide-and-reference/top/compiler-reference/compiler-options/compiler-option-details/compatibility-options/gcc-toolchain.html)
like:

```sh
export CXXFLAGS=--gcc-toolchain=/opt/rh/gcc-toolset-10/root/usr/
```

which can be determined like:

```sh
scl enable gcc-toolset-10 "which g++"
```

**Cray PE** works with GCC or Intel backends.
The Cray compiler itself works with the non-C++ fallback.

## Build

Fortran-filesystem can be built with CMake or Fortran Package Manager (FPM).

[lib]filesystem.a is the library binary built that contains the Fortran "filesystem" module--it is the only binary you need to use in your project.

Please see the [API docs](./API.md) for extensive list of functions/subroutines.

CMake:

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
# optional
ctest --test-dir build
```

Fortran Package Manager (fallback functions):

```sh
fpm build
```

## Command line

For user convenience, we provide a demo executable "filesystem_cli" that allows simple testing of what the filesystem routines do.
To build the filesystem_cli utility:

```sh
cmake -B build -DBUILD_UTILS=on
cmake --build build
```

## Usage from other projects

The [example](./example) directory contains a use pattern from external projects.
One can either `cmake --install build` or use ExternalProject from the other project.
[ffilesystem.cmake](./cmake/ffilesystem.cmake) would be included from the other project to find or build Fortran-filesystem automatically.
It provides the appropriate imported targets for shared or static builds, including Windows DLL handling.

## Concepts

The [concepts](./concepts/) directory shows a few concepts for future consideration.

[exe_dir](./concepts/exe_dir/)
is a working example of how to determine an exeucutable's full path no matter what the current working directory is.
This can be useful when a data file is known to exist relative to an executable.
This is relevant to say CMake installed project that has an executable and associated data files installed.
Assuming the user knows the path to the MAIN executable in the installed directory, the program can determine its own full path and
then a priori know the relative path to the data file(s).

## Notes

A few topics on unsupported features:

### non-ASCII characters

The UCS
[selected_char_kind('ISO_10646')](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/SELECTED_005fCHAR_005fKIND.html),
is an *optional* feature of Fortran 2003 standard.
Intel oneAPI does not support `selected_char_kind('ISO_10646')` as of this writing.

filesystem currently uses the default Fortran `character` kind, which is ASCII.
This means that UTF-8 / UTF-16 / UTF-32 strings are not supported.
You may find a particular compiler and computer passes some non-ASCII strings, but this is not supported.
